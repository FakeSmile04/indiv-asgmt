uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The Javascript interation with the webpage are as follows:
-By default, the <fieldset> tag with id "kul" is hidden by default in CSS when the webpage is loaded
-If the user clicks on the checkbox under kulliyyah-based donation question, the webpage will show the fieldset above,
containing a dropdown list for all kulliyyahs in Gombak Campus
-This is done using Javascipt as an event handler is placed to the checkbox (id "box") to see if it's checked or not
-If it's checked, Javascript will change the style property of "kul" class to show the contents
-If it's not checked, Javascript will change the style property to hide the contents.
